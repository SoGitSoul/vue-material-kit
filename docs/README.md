# Short Description and Usage

Vue Material Dashboard PRO is a beautiful resource built over [Vue Material](https://vuematerial.io/) and [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/). It will help you get started developing dashboards in no time. Vue Material Dashboard PRO is the official Vuejs version of the Original Material Dashboard PRO.  

## Getting Started
- Install Nodejs from [Nodejs Official Page](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Open your terminal
- Navigate to the project
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` if you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- Run `npm run dev` or `yarn serve` to start a local development server
- A new tab will be opened in your browser

You can also run additional npm tasks such as
- `npm run build` to build your app for production
- `npm run lint` to run linting.

## Vue-cli

We used the latest 3.x [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) which aims to reduce project configuration
to as little as possible. Almost everything is inside `package.json` + some other related files such as
`.babelrc`, `.eslintrc.js` and `.postcssrc.js`

## Element-UI

  Vue Now Material Dashboard also uses [element-ui](https://vuematerial.io/ui-elements/elevation) components and restyles them to achieve consistent and homogenous interface with the existing custom components and general UI of the dashboard.
